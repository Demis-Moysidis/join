        we work with various external parties. In some cases, the transfer of personal data to these external parties
        is necessary. We only share personal data with external parties if this is required for the fulfillment of a
        contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate
        interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the
        data transfer. When using processors, we only transfer our customers’ personal data on the basis of a valid
        data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke any consent you have
        already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.</p>

        GDPR)</h3>

        PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN
        THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
        DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
        OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA.
        1 GDPR).</p>
    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE
        PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING

        authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or the place of the
        alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial
        remedies.</p>
    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a
        contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
        transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically
        feasible.</p>
    <h3>Right of access, rectification and erasure</h3>
    <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain free
        information
        about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if
        applicable, a right to rectification or erasure of this data. You can contact us at any time for this or for
        further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>
    <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any
        time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
            duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
            personal data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing
            instead of erasure.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you
            have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.</li>
        <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must
            be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
            request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be
        processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of
        the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union
        or a Member State.</p>
